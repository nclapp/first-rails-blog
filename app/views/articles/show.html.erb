<!-- If you want to link to an action in the same controller, you don't need to specify the :controller option, as Rails will use the current controller by default. -->

<!-- The second render just defines the partial template we want to render, comments/form. Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to render the _form.html.erb file in the app/views/comments directory. -->

<!-- The @article object is available to any partials rendered in the view because we defined it as an instance variable. -->
