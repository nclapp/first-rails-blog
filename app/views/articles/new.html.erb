<h1>New Article</h1>

<%= render 'form' %>

<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>

<%# form_for :article, url: articles_path do|f| %>
<!-- creates a new form, cool. articles_path helper directs submit button to post to /articles instead of default, which was '/articles/new' before adding the 'url: articles_path' part -->

<!-- pluralize method is badass! -->

<!-- Rails automatically wraps fields that contain an error with a div with class field_with_errors. You can define a css rule to make them standout. -->
